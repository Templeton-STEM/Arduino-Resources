## General Resources
### Arduino Reference
Arduino Language Reference:

## Circuit Diagram Tools
### Wokwi
Wokwi also lets you run Arduino simulations so you can test your code/wiring without a physical arduino!

### TinkerCad
Probably the easiest option, but is missing a lot of functionality (missing components, no simulation). Also lets you switch to a standard schematic diagram.

### Circuito.io
Similar to Wokwi, different interface.
